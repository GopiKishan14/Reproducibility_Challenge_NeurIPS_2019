    "# Paper Overview\n",
    "The paper introduces a new algorithm for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player games. The method is a natural generalization of gradient descent to the two-player setting where the update is given by the Nash equilibrium of a regularized bilinear local approximation of the underlying game. It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient descent. Convergence and stability properties of the method are robust to strong interactions between the players, without adapting the stepsize, which is not the case with previous methods. The ability to choose larger stepsizes furthermore allows the algorithm to achieve faster convergence, as measured by the number of model evaluations (See the [report](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/) experiments section).\n"

    "## Background\n",
    "The traditional optimization is concerned with a single agent trying to optimize a cost function. It\n",

    "\n",
    "The paper talks about Competitive optimization. Competitive optimization extends this problem\n",
    "to the setting of multiple agents each trying to minimize their own cost function, which in general\n",
    "depends on the actions of all agents.\n",
    " The paper deals with the case of two such agents:\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",
    "        &\\min_{x \\in R^m} f(x,y),\\ \\ \\ \\min_{y \\in R^n} g(x,y)\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    for two functions $f,g: R^m \\times R^n \\longrightarrow R$.\n",

    "In single agent optimization, the solution of the problem consists of the minimizer of the cost function.\n",
