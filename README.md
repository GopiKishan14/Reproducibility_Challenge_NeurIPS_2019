# Abstract
This is a report for reproducibility challenge of NeurlIPS’19 on the paper `Competitive
gradient descent` [(Schäfer et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103). The paper introduces a novel algorithm
for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player
games. It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient
descent.
The paper proposes several experiments to establish the robustness of their method. This project
aims at replicating their results.
