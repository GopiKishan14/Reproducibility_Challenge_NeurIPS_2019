# Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019

## Abstract

This repository contains the sources for reproducibility challenge of NeurlIPS’19 on the paper `Competitive
gradient descent` [(Schäfer et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103). The paper introduces a novel algorithm
for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player games. It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient descent.
The paper proposes several experiments to establish the robustness of their method. This project aims at replicating their results.

The [reproducibility report](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/index.html) contains a short description of the method proposed in the original paper and analysis of replication of experiments. 

This projects also brings a more high lavel introduction to the original paper through this [blog](https://gopikishan14.github.io/Reproducibility_Challenge_NeurIPS_2019/README.html). The blog also contains the implementation details of the proposed algorithm in python3 (based on PyTorch).
